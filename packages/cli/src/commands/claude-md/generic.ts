export const GENERIC_CLAUDE_MD = `# CLAUDE.md — WellPlayed project

This file tells Claude Code (and other AI agents) the rules for working in
this WellPlayed-powered project. Bundled skills under \`.claude/skills/\` go
deeper on individual SDKs and the \`wellplayed\` CLI; this file holds the
project-wide rules that apply *everywhere*.

If you change anything here, keep the **GraphQL Rule** section intact — it is
the single most important convention.

## Quick reference

- **GraphQL toolkit**: \`@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk\` exports a typed
  \`graphql\` function (powered by \`gql.tada\` + WellPlayed schema
  introspection). It statically types every operation against the live schema.
- **Clients** (both ship from \`@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk\`):
  - \`createWellPlayedClient(...)\` — fully-wired Apollo client (HTTP +
    WebSocket subscriptions + localStorage cache persist) for browser apps.
  - \`createTypedClient(...)\` — lower-level batched HTTP client suitable
    for Node scripts, CLI tools, and server-side code.
- **CLI**: \`wellplayed\` — see \`.claude/skills/wellplayed-cli/SKILL.md\`.
  Notable commands: \`wellplayed graphql\` for ad-hoc API calls,
  \`wellplayed login\`, \`wellplayed install-skills\` (also rewrites this
  file).
- **Schema lookups**: WellPlayed MCP at \`https://mcp.well-played.gg/mcp\`
  (already wired in \`.mcp.json\`).

## GraphQL Rule (MANDATORY)

**Always declare GraphQL documents with the typed \`graphql\` function exported
by \`@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk\`. Never use \`gql\` from \`graphql\`,
\`graphql-tag\`, or \`@apollo/client\`.**

Why this matters:

- \`graphql\` from \`@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk\` is built on
  \`gql.tada\` and the WellPlayed schema introspection. It infers the result
  type and variables type of every operation directly from the document.
- All client call sites (Apollo \`query\`/\`mutate\`/\`subscribe\`,
  \`createTypedClient\` calls, React hooks if you use the React SDK) infer
  their generics automatically — you never need to write \`<TData, TVars>\`
  or hand-author matching \`interface\`/\`type\` declarations.
- Schema mismatches (typos, removed fields, wrong argument types) are caught
  at compile time, not at runtime.
- \`gql\` from any other library returns an opaque \`DocumentNode\` and
  silently turns all of those guarantees off.

### Do this

\`\`\`ts
import { graphql, type ResultOf } from '@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk';

const GET_MY_ACCOUNT = graphql(\`
  query getMyAccount {
    getMyAccount {
      id
      email
      permissions { permission }
    }
  }
\`);

type MyAccount = ResultOf<typeof GET_MY_ACCOUNT>['getMyAccount'];

// Apollo client (browser):
const { data } = await client.query({ query: GET_MY_ACCOUNT });
// data.getMyAccount is fully typed — no <TData> generic.
\`\`\`

### Don't do this

\`\`\`ts
// Forbidden — opaque DocumentNode, no schema check, no inferred types.
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_MY_ACCOUNT = gql\`
  query getMyAccount { getMyAccount { id email } }
\`;

// Equally forbidden.
import { gql } from 'graphql-tag';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
\`\`\`

### Helper types

Need to extract a result, variables, or fragment type? Use the helpers
re-exported next to \`graphql\` — never re-derive the shape by hand.

\`\`\`ts
import {
  graphql,
  type ResultOf,
  type VariablesOf,
  type FragmentOf,
  readFragment,
} from '@well-played.gg/typescript-sdk';

const Q = graphql(\`query Foo { foo { id name } }\`);

type Result = ResultOf<typeof Q>;     // { foo: { id: string; name: string } }
type Vars = VariablesOf<typeof Q>;    // operation variables, fully inferred
\`\`\`

For fragments: declare them with \`graphql(\\\`fragment ...\\\`)\`, type them
with \`FragmentOf<typeof MyFragment>\`, and read them with \`readFragment\`.
Never spread the raw fragment payload into a fragment-typed slot — it
bypasses the masking gql.tada provides.

## Authentication

The typescript-sdk supports two flows:

- **User-token flow** — pass a \`token\` (OAuth/OIDC access token) you
  already have to \`createWellPlayedClient\` / \`createTypedClient\`. If your
  project also pulls in \`@well-played.gg/react-sdk\`, that flow is what its
  React provider wires up automatically.
- **Application flow** — pass \`application: { clientId, clientSecret }\`
  and the SDK exchanges them for a service token via the WellPlayed OAuth
  endpoint. Use this for backend services, CI jobs, and scripts.

Both flows require an \`organizationId\` (the org short id). In Node-side
code, never hardcode tokens or client secrets — load them from environment
variables.

## Working with the API

- **In code**: use \`createWellPlayedClient\` (browser, with subscriptions)
  or \`createTypedClient\` (Node, batched HTTP). Both accept typed
  \`graphql(...)\` documents directly — no per-call generics needed.
- **Ad-hoc / scripts / CI**: use \`wellplayed graphql\`. It accepts an
  inline query, a \`-f\` file, or stdin, and supports typed \`-F\`
  variables. Full reference: \`.claude/skills/wellplayed-cli/SKILL.md\`.
- **Schema exploration**: prefer the WellPlayed MCP server over manually
  crawling the introspection blob. Claude Code is already wired through
  \`.mcp.json\`.

## TypeScript conventions

- **Strict mode stays on.** Don't loosen \`tsconfig.json\`.
- **No \`any\` / \`unknown\` shortcuts.** The typed \`graphql(...)\` document
  is the escape hatch for API types — there is no excuse to fall back to
  \`any\` for query results.
- **No \`as\` casts** to massage a query result into a different shape.
  Re-shape the document instead.
- **No \`// @ts-ignore\` / \`// @ts-expect-error\`** to silence a schema
  mismatch. Either the document is wrong, the schema changed (regenerate
  introspection), or the field really doesn't exist — never silence it.
- **Type every function signature** explicitly. \`gql.tada\`'s inferred
  generics already flow through the SDK clients; lean on that, don't
  bypass it.

## What lives where

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| \`.claude/skills/\` | Bundled SDK + CLI skills (regenerate with \`wellplayed install-skills\`) |
| \`.mcp.json\` | MCP server entries; keeps Claude Code wired to the WellPlayed schema |
